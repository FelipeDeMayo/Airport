Airport
Runway Takeoff Control ✈️ 

Develop a Python algorithm to manage the takeoff queue at an airport. The system helps operators, airlines, and passengers view information about planes in line, ensuring efficient control and clear details about upcoming flights.

Features The developed algorithm must meet the following requirements:

Allow the takeoff of the first plane in line: Remove the plane at the front of the takeoff queue, simulating its takeoff. Add a plane to the takeoff queue: Insert a new plane at the end of the takeoff queue. Display the total number of planes waiting in line: Show the number of planes currently waiting to take off. List all planes in the takeoff queue: Display a list of details for all planes currently in the takeoff queue. List the characteristics of the next plane to take off: Show the information of the plane at the front of the queue, which is next in line for takeoff. Show the position of a plane in the queue based on the flight number: Find a plane in the queue using its flight number and display its position. The code follows Design Patterns principles, utilizing deques for queue management and employing conditional structures for efficient control flow and data handling.
